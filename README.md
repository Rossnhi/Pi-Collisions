# Pi-Collisions
A block is sent off with a velocity on a frictionless surface to collide with a stationary block of a different mass which is then sent off towards a wall. Then there is a series of collisions of the second block, back and forth the wall and the first block. When the number mass of the first block is a power of 100 times the mass of the second block, the **digits of Pi** appear in the number of collisions.
